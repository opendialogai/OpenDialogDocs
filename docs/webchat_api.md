## Webchat API documentation

The webchat API is documented in Postman [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3532544/TVmLAdPF)

As well as full documentation for the 3 main endpoints (`webchat-config`, `history` and `incoming`), the Postman collection can be saved locally to make real API calls against the [OpenDialog Demo](https://od-demo.opendialog.ai).
